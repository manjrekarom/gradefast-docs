Welcome to Gradefast's documentation!

*Are you a teacher, professor or a teaching assistant? Are you organising
a programming competition or conducting a MOOC? If you are someone who is
looking to batch evaluate programming assignments or projects (however
complicated) and looking for an open source alternative, then you are at
the right place.*

**Gradefast** *is here to help you.*

Gradefast sets up the stage for you to download assignments, quickly evaluate
them and upload the results back to the portal. It has nice features that you
and I need when evaluating submissions, like *plagiarism checking* and *secure
environment* being some of the important ones.
