Directory Structure
-------------------

When downloading submission items, gradefast follows a convention to name
and save files. The information embedded in the directory strucutre is used
again when repopulating a submission group object, given the download directory
path.

When you are testing your auto-eval scripts and you don't have a url (page) to
download submissions from, you may have to create directory structure by hand,
so that gradefast can use that information to populate a submission group
object. For this reason, it is necessary to know the conventions.

Following are the conventions:

1. Root folder can be named anything ``e.g. 'task0', 'mocking_bot_task1' or
   'anything'``
2. The root folder can contain a `.json` file, typically named
   **submission.json**.
3. Folders inside of root folder should be numbers which indicate team_id
   (or student_id). 
   ``e.g. '4', '1181', '777'`` All the team (or student)
   data should go inside of this folder. 
4. Files should be named **<team_id>_<file-item-name>.<file-extension>**.
   ``e.g. '7_zip.zip', '926_png.png', '86_zip2.zip', '413_txt3.txt'``
5. Unzipped folders are named as **<team_id>_<file-item-name>_unzipped**
   ``e.g. '7_zip.zip' becomes '7_zip_unzipped' and '86_zip2.zip' becomes
   '86_zip2_unzipped'``

Below are some examples of file items and the directory they should make
when present locally on disk.

Example 1

Note that we only downloaded **png** and **txt** files in this case.

Example 2
