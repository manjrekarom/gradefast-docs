Aggregating gradefast results
-----------------------------

Gradefast provides utilities for combining, joining, and adding results
in result_groups.

Combining multiple result groups
................................

You have obtained a result_group from a specific test that you ran on
some share of submissions. You were being supported by other theme developers
or TAs all this while who ran same tests on other half of the entire batch of
submissions. Now you have to club their result groups and finally upload all
of that to the portal.

You can do that by using :attr:`~gradefast.Aggregate.combine()`

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/recipes/aggregate_result.py
    :lines: 1-15, 22-33

Find total of result dictionary parameters
..........................................

To report a final grade, you would want to add result dictionary parameters
in the result group. You can do that by using
:attr:`~gradefast.Aggregate.add()`

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/recipes/aggregate_result.py
    :lines: 1-15, 34-44

Joining result groups from different tests
..........................................

If your submission consisted of different files that you evaluated using
multiple tests, you may want to join results of teams to get a one compiled
result. You can do that by using :attr:`~gradefast.Aggregate.join()`

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/recipes/aggregate_result.py
    :lines: 1-9, 16-21, 45-
