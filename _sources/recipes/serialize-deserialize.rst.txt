Saving gradefast objects as JSON and CSV for later use
------------------------------------------------------

Gradefast provides utility methods to store objects from
:mod:`~gradefast.submission` and :mod:`~gradefast.result` into json and csv.

.. note::

    For formats that we don't support yet, you can
    :ref:`convert gradefast objects <type-conversion-recipe>` to python
    primitives and pass them as argument to other python packages that do the
    conversion.
