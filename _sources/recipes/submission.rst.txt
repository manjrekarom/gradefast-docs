Loading student submissions
---------------------------

Load submissions from URL
.........................
Easiest way to load submissions is from a web page that shows information
about tasks and links to uploaded files. Note that you need to call
:attr:`~gradefast.submission.LoadSubmissions.get_submissions()` on
:class:`~gradefast.submission.LoadSubmissions` object to fetch submission
information. You can also download the submissions locally in one more step.

Load submissions from filesystem
................................
Sometimes you might not have a web page to download the data from, for
example when you are still testing your auto-eval scripts and the
competition has not yet started. Check out this tutorial to learn how to
create a proper directory structure so that gradefast can make a submission
group.

If you have already downloaded submission locally with gradefast from a URL,
there shouldn't be any need for you to be logged into internet to populate a
submission group object. When you download files with gradefast, we save a file
`submission.json` in the same folder so that the submission group object can be
rebuilt from it.

For both these cases you can populate a
:class:`~gradefast.submission.SubmissionGroup` using
:class:`~gradefast.submission.LoadSubmissions` as follows:
