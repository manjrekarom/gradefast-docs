Converting between gradefast objects and python types
------------------------------------------------------

You can convert gradefast objects into primitive python types like dictionaries
and list of dictionaries. Most of these methods start with a `to_<type>` and
`from_<type>`.

Converting a result and a result group
.......................................

Gradefast provides to_dict methods to convert objects to dictionary. It is
done to ensure interoperability with other python frameworks like pandas. You
can then use the dictionary with other python packages and module like json
module or pandas module.

A dictionary can be nested. One may want a non-nested dictionary represntation
like when you need to serialize the results into a csv. If your particular use
case has such a requirement you can use these methods.
